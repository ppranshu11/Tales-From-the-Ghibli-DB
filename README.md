**Tales From the Ghibli DB (SQL)**



**Introduction**  
Have you ever found yourself enchanted by the magical worlds of Studio Ghibli? From the gentle Totoro to the fearless Howl, Ghibli’s characters are more than just animated figures—they’re emotional touchstones in beautifully crafted stories. As an artist inspired by Ghibli's whimsical scenery, I decided to explore their universe from a new perspective: through data. Using SQL, I set out to uncover what lies beneath the surface of these iconic characters.

**Objective**  
The goal of this project is to delve into the data behind Studio Ghibli characters—examining their traits, relationships, and unique qualities using SQL. Think of it as peeling back the layers of an animated fairy tale to discover the hidden patterns within.

**What I Did with SQL**  
I used SQL to investigate various aspects of Ghibli characters—from their demographics to their magical abilities. Every query was a step deeper into their world. My toolkit included:  
- `SELECT` statements  
- Aggregation functions (`AVG()`, `COUNT()`)  
- `JOIN`s and subqueries  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window functions like `RANK()`  
- Conditional logic with `CASE WHEN`  
- Array operations (`UNNEST()`, `string_to_array()`)

**Key Insights**

- **Age & Gender Distribution:** Ghibli characters average around 11 years old. Males make up 55% while females represent 44% of the character pool.  
- **Top Regions by Height:** Characters from Japan, Europe, and Wales generally tower above the average. Japan is home to the tallest character—Totoro at 215cm!  
- **Shared Special Powers:** Characters like Arren and Ashitaka both exhibit super strength and agility, while Fanny and Fujimoto share shape-shifting and size manipulation abilities.  
- **Species Breakdown:** Humans dominate the Ghibli world at 71%. Spirits and cats follow, adding their own touch of magic.  
- **Unique Powers:** Some characters stand out with abilities no one else has—Totoro can teleport, Haku can shape-shift, and Howl boasts flight and powerful magic.  
- **Height Rankings:** Totoro leads the list at 215cm, closely followed by Okkoto at 200cm.  
- **Post-2000 Characters:** Characters like Haku and Howl, introduced after 2000, stand tall—both literally and metaphorically.  
- **Power Count:** A few characters—Okkoto, Arren, San, Howl, and Princess Kaguya—each possess three unique abilities, highlighting their depth and significance.

**Conclusion**  
This project shows how even the most magical stories can be explored through data. SQL helped bring hidden details to light, revealing new dimensions of Ghibli’s characters. It's a reminder that behind every animation lies a story—and sometimes, that story is told best through the language of data. The journey isn’t over; there are still more Ghibli tales waiting to be discovered, one query at a time.
